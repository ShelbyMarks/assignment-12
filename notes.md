### Overview

I got the set-up for this working - leveraging a large amount from Hot Restauraunt. I got the form right and got it loggin in the a table on the home page. I updated some of the font.awesome shenanigans and customized everything I look for in compatability.


### What I still need to work on
*How to upload pictures
*Getting matches to populate based on results
*

### What I strugggled with
*Getting logic together that matched users based on their answers
*
